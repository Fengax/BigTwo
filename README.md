# BigTwo
A program that lets players play the famous card game "BigTwo", against 3 other expert bots. 
The program is split into 3 different modes. The **one card mode (onecard.py)** only allows players to play single cards. In future updates there will be **doubles/triples mode** and **full mode**, which allows players to play doubles, triples, and five card combinations.
